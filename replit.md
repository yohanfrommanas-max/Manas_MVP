# Manas — Mental Wellness App

## Overview

Manas (Sanskrit for "mind/soul") is a premium mobile wellness app built with React Native and Expo. It targets iOS, Android, and web platforms from a single codebase. The app has three core pillars:

1. **Focus** — Brain training cognitive games (Signal Spotter, Story Recall, Code Cracker, etc.)
2. **Calm** — Guided breathwork, sleep soundscapes, and curated ambient music
3. **Journal** — Daily mood tracking, guided prompts, and personal reflection entries

The app starts with an onboarding flow (feature flashcards + a 5-step personalization quiz), then routes into a 5-tab main interface: Home, Explore, Favourites, Progress, and Profile.

## System Architecture

### Frontend (React Native / Expo)

- **Framework**: Expo SDK ~54 with Expo Router v6 for file-based navigation
- **Navigation structure**:
  - `app/_layout.tsx` — Root layout, handles auth/onboarding redirect logic
  - `app/(tabs)/` — Main tab group: `index`, `explore`, `favourites`, `progress`, `profile`
  - `app/onboarding.tsx` — First-launch flashcard + quiz flow
  - `app/game/[id].tsx` — Dynamic game screen
  - `app/breathe/[id].tsx` — Dynamic breathwork session screen
  - `app/sleep.tsx`, `app/music.tsx` (full music player with 4-tab UI, mini player, now playing, sleep timer), `app/journal.tsx` — Feature screens
  - `app/journal/[id].tsx` — Journal entry detail view (full text, mood, prompt, AI reflection)
  - `app/legal/_layout.tsx` + `app/legal/[slug].tsx` — Legal/support stack with dynamic content screens (about, privacy, terms, data, help, contact, bug, rate)
- **State management**: React Context (`AppContext`) backed by `AsyncStorage` for local persistence. Tracks user profile, mood logs, journal entries, game stats, favourites, streaks, wellness minutes, theme preference (`'dark'|'light'`), and exposes `totalWellnessLogs`, `clearAllData`, `signOut`
- **Data fetching**: TanStack React Query (`@tanstack/react-query`) with a custom `queryClient` configured to talk to the Express backend via `EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN`
- **Animations**: React Native Reanimated v4 for gestures, transitions, breathing orbs, and micro-interactions. React Native Gesture Handler for swipe/pan interactions
- **Styling**: `StyleSheet` with theming support — `constants/colors.ts` exports `DARK` and `LIGHT` palettes plus a `useColors()` hook that reads the active theme from `AppContext`. Static `C = DARK` export provides backward compat for module-level `StyleSheet.create`. Dark theme: `#0D0F14` background, lavender/sage/gold accent system. Light theme: `#F5F3FF` warm off-white lavender-tinted background
- **Typography**: Inter font family via `@expo-google-fonts/inter`
- **Audio**: Custom `useAmbientAudio` hook using the Web Audio API (`AudioContext`) to procedurally generate ambient sounds (white/pink/brown noise, oscillators) — no audio files needed
- **Platform differences**: iOS uses `NativeTabs` with SF Symbols and Liquid Glass if available; Android/web falls back to classic `Tabs` with `BlurView` or solid backgrounds

### Backend (Express)

- **Framework**: Express 5 (`server/index.ts`)
- **Routes**: Registered via `server/routes.ts` — currently only `POST /api/pin/verify` for PIN authentication
- **Storage**: `server/storage.ts` provides a `MemStorage` class (in-memory) implementing a `IStorage` interface with basic user CRUD. Designed to be swapped for a database-backed implementation
- **CORS**: Custom middleware allows requests from Replit dev/deployment domains and localhost

### Database

- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect (`drizzle.config.ts` points to `DATABASE_URL`)
- **Schema** (`shared/schema.ts`): Currently defines a `users` table with `id` (UUID), `username`, and `password`. Validation via `drizzle-zod`
- **Migrations**: Output to `./migrations/` via `drizzle-kit push`
- **Note**: The database schema is minimal/starter. The main user data (profile, mood, journal, games) is stored client-side in AsyncStorage, not in the database yet

### Onboarding & Auth Flow

- On app load, `AppContext` reads `AsyncStorage` for a saved user profile
- If `user.onboardingComplete` is false (or no user), the app redirects to `/onboarding`
- Onboarding collects: mood baseline, goals (multi-select), preferred wellness time, meditation experience, and name
- After onboarding, the user is routed to `/(tabs)` permanently

### Premium / Free Plan

- `UserProfile.plan` field is either `'free'` or `'premium'`
- Certain games, sleep sounds (`delta`), and music playlists (`golden`) are marked `premium: true`
- A `PremiumModal` in the profile tab presents upgrade options (no payment integration yet)
